# Airplane Seating Ethicacy 

## **Current Issue** : Among other problems, the current set up for buying tickets would often separate families and also would not allow priority for anyone who was ability diverse.

###Possible Solutions:
I think that an algorithm could be included that first looks at some simple questions such as:
1. Do you have children?
2. Are you ability diverse and need an accommodation? 

If these questions were taken into account BEFORE allowing anyone else (for example Economy Plus) to pick seats, then these families might be able to stay together and anyone who needs accommodations could receive those.

I think this could be done using simple conditional statements within the functions written. Before the seats are randomized it could check the answers and then assign those seats before randomizing the rest.
